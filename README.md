# Rain_Check
My first somewhat-complete app, it ain't perfect but its a milestone nonetheless

A simple weather application built using:
- HTML
- CSS (Flexbox + Grid)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Open-Meteo APIs

Features:
- City search
- Current weather display
- Weather code → icon mapping
- Error handling for invalid input
- Responsive mobile layout
